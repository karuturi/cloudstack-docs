  <para>The Hyper-V Agent helps &PRODUCT; perform operations on the Hyper-V hosts. This Agent
    communicates with the Management Server and controls all the instances on the host. Each Hyper-V
    host must have the Hyper-V Agent installed on it for successful interaction between the host and
    &PRODUCT;. The Hyper-V Agent runs as a Windows service. Install the Agent on each host using the
    following steps.</para>
  <para>&PRODUCT; Management Server communicates with Hyper-V Agent by using HTTPS. For secure
    communication between the Management Server and the host, install a self-signed certificate on
    port 8250.</para>
