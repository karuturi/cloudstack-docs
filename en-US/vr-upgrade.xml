  <title>Rolling Upgrade for System VMs</title>
  <para>Upgrading System VMs is made flexible. The &PRODUCT; administrators will be able to control
    the sequence of the System VM upgrades. The sequencing is based on Infrastructure hierarchy,
    such as by Cluster, Pod, or Zone, and Administrative hierarchy, such as by Tenant or Domain. As
    an administrator, you can also determine when a particular customer service, such as VR, is
    upgraded within a specified upgrade interval. During the entire duration of the upgrade, users
    can launch new services or make changes to an existing service. Additionally, upgrade operation
    is enhanced to increase the upgrade speed by allowing as many upgrade operations in parallel as
    possible.</para>
