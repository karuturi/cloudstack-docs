  <title>Enhanced Upgrade for Virtual Routers</title>
  <para>Upgrading VR is made flexible. The &PRODUCT; administrators will be able to control the
    sequence of the VR upgrades. The sequencing is based on Infrastructure hierarchy, such as by
    Cluster, Pod, or Zone, and Administrative (Account) hierarchy, such as by Tenant or Domain. As
    an administrator, you can also determine when a particular customer service, such as VR, is
    upgraded within a specified upgrade interval. During the entire duration of the upgrade, users
    can launch new services or make changes to an existing service. Upgrade operation is enhanced to
    increase the upgrade speed by allowing as many upgrade operations in parallel as
    possible.</para>
  <para>Additionally, using multiple versions of VRs in a single instance is supported. In the
    Details tab of a VR, you can view the version and whether it requires upgrade. During the
    Management Server upgrade, &PRODUCT; checks whether VR is at the latest version before
    performing any operation on the VR. Operation is not performed if the VR is not at the latest
    version. Services of the older version VR continue to be available, but no further operations
    can be performed on the VR until it is upgraded to the latest version. This will be a transient
    state until the VR is upgraded. This will ensure that the availability of VR services and VR
    state is not impacted due to the Management Server upgrade.</para>
  <para>The following service will be available even if the VR is not upgraded. However, no changes
    for any of the services can be sent to the VR, until it is upgraded:</para>
