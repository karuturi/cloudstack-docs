  <title>Compute and Disk Service Offerings</title>
  <para>A service offering is a set of virtual hardware features such as CPU core count and speed,
    memory, and disk size. The &PRODUCT; administrator can set up various offerings, and then end
    users choose from the available offerings when they create a new VM. Based on the user’s
    selected offering, &PRODUCT; emits usage records that can be integrated with billing
    systems.</para>
  <para>Some characteristics of service offerings must be defined by the &PRODUCT; administrator,
    and others can be left undefined so that the end-user can enter their own desired values. This
    is useful to reduce the number of offerings the &PRODUCT; administrator has to define. Instead
    of defining a compute offering for every imaginable combination of values that a user might
    want, the administrator can define offerings that provide some flexibility to the users and can
    serve as the basis for several different VM configurations.</para>
  <para>A service offering includes the following elements:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>CPU, memory, and network resource guarantees</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>How resources are metered</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>How the resource usage is charged</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>How often the charges are generated</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>For example, one service offering might allow users to create a virtual machine instance
    that is equivalent to a 1 GHz Intel® Core™ 2 CPU, with 1 GB memory at $0.20/hour, with network
    traffic metered at $0.10/GB.</para>
  <para>&PRODUCT; separates service offerings into compute offerings and disk offerings. The compute
    service offering specifies:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Guest CPU (optional). If not defined by the &PRODUCT; administrator, users can pick the
        CPU attributes.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Guest RAM (optional). If not defined by the &PRODUCT; administrator, users can pick the
        RAM.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Guest Networking type (virtual or direct)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Tags on the root disk</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>The disk offering specifies:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Disk size (optional). If not defined by the &PRODUCT; administrator, users can pick the
        disk size.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Tags on the data disk</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
