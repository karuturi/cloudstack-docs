  <title>Custom Compute Offering</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; provides you the flexibility to specify the desired values for the number of CPU,
    CPU speed, and memory while deploying a VM. As an admin, you create a Compute Offering by
    marking it as custom, and the users will be able to customize this dynamic Compute Offering by
    specifying the memory, and CPU at the time of VM creation or upgrade. Custom Compute Offering is
    same as the normal Compute Offering except that the values of the dynamic parameters will be set
    to zeros in the given set of templates. Use this offering to deploy VM by specifying custom
    values for the dynamic parameters. Memory, CPU and number of CPUs are considered as dynamic
    parameters. </para>
  <para>Dynamic Compute Offerings can be used in following cases: deploying a VM, changing the
    compute offering of a stopped VM and running VMs, which is nothing but scaling up. To support
    this feature a new field, Custom, has been added to the Create Compute Offering page. If the
    Custom field is checked, the user will be able to create a custom Compute Offering by filling in
    the desired values for number of CPU, CPU speed, and memory. See <xref
      linkend="creating-compute-offerings"/> for more information on this.</para>
  <formalpara>
    <title>Recording Usage Events for Dynamically Assigned Resources</title>
    <para>To support this feature, usage events has been enhanced to register events for dynamically
      assigned resources. Usage events are registered when a VM is created from a custom compute
      offering, and upon changing the compute offering of a stopped or running VM. The values of the
      parameters, such as CPU, speed, RAM are recorded. </para>
