  <title>Reporting CPU Sockets</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; manages different types of hosts that contains one or more physical CPU sockets.
    CPU socket is considered as a unit of measure used for licensing and billing cloud
    infrastructure. &PRODUCT; provides both UI and API support to collect the CPU socket statistics
    for billing purpose. The Infrastructure tab has a new tab for CPU sockets. You can view the
    statistics for CPU sockets managed by &PRODUCT;, which in turn reflects the size of the cloud.
    The CPU Socket page will give you the number of hosts and sockets used for each host
    type.</para>
