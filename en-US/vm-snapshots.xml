  <title>Virtual Machine Snapshots</title>
  <para>(Supported on VMware and XenServer)</para>
  <para>In addition to the existing &PRODUCT; ability to snapshot individual VM
    volumes, you can take a VM snapshot to preserve all the VM's data volumes as well as
    (optionally) its CPU/memory state. This is useful for quick restore of a VM. For example, you
    can snapshot a VM, then make changes such as software upgrades. If anything goes wrong, simply
    restore the VM to its previous state using the previously saved VM snapshot. </para>
  <para>The snapshot is created using the hypervisor's native snapshot facility. The VM snapshot includes
    not only the data volumes, but optionally also whether the VM is running or turned off (CPU
    state) and the memory contents. The snapshot is stored in &PRODUCT;'s primary storage.</para>
  <para>VM snapshots can have a parent/child relationship. Each successive snapshot of the same VM
    is the child of the snapshot that came before it. Each time you take an additional snapshot of
    the same VM, it saves only the differences between the current state of the VM and the state
    stored in the most recent previous snapshot. The previous snapshot becomes a parent, and the new
    snapshot is its child. It is possible to create a long chain of these parent/child snapshots,
    which amount to a "redo" record leading from the current state of the VM back to the
    original.</para>
  <para>If you need more information about VM snapshots on VMware, check out the VMware documentation and the
    VMware Knowledge Base, especially <ulink

    <title>Limitations on VM Snapshots</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If a VM has some stored snapshots, you can't attach new volume to the VM or delete any
          existing volumes. If you change the volumes on the VM, it would become impossible to
          restore the VM snapshot which was created with the previous volume structure. If you want
          to attach a volume to such a VM, first delete its snapshots.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>VM snapshots which include both data volumes and memory can't be kept if you change
          the VM's service offering. Any existing VM snapshots of this type will be
          discarded.</para>
